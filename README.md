## Introduction
This [main.ipynb](https://github.com/jy-cs/SL-Consumed-Energy-vs-Building-Parameters/blob/main/main.ipynb) presents an analysis of a dataset consisting of energy efficiency responses and eight building features based on statistical learning methods. Our goal is to apply various statistical learning methods, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regres- sion, to identify the relationships between energy consumption and different parameters in buildings. We propose to use Python for the computational experiments conducted in this study. In addition, our study aims to determine the extent to which these methods can accurately predict energy efficiency based on the building features. In the latter section of the report, we will discuss the methodology used to analyze the dataset and the findings obtained from the experiments. Finally, the results of the experiments provide people who seek to improve energy efficiency and promote sustainable buildings a guide.

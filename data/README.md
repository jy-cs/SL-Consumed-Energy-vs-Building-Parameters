# Data Descriptions

To conduct an energy analysis, we used Ecotect to simulate 12 distinct building shapes that varied in factors such as glazing area, distribution of glazing area, and orientation. By modifying these parameters, we generated 768 building shapes and tested various configurations based on the mentioned characteristics. Our dataset consists of 768 samples and 8 features, with the goal of predicting two responses that are expressed in real values. If rounded to the nearest integer, this dataset can also be used for a multi-class classification problem. The 8 features and 2 responses are as : _X<sub>1</sub>_ Relative Compactness, X<sub>2</sub> Surface Area, X<sub>3</sub> Wall Area, X<sub>4</sub> Roof Area, X<sub>5</sub> Overall Height, X<sub>6</sub> Orientation, X<sub>7</sub> Glazing Area, X<sub>8</sub> Glazing Area Distribution, Y<sub>1</sub> Heating Load, and Y<sub>2</sub> Cooling Load.
